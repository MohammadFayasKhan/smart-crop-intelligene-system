-----------------
Agricultural disease knowledge base and threshold-based detection engine.

Sensor inputs:
    temperature   → °C from DHT11
    humidity      → % from DHT11
    rain          → 1 = raining / 0 = dry  (YL-83 binary digital output)
    soil_moisture → 0-100% from soil sensor

NOTE: The rain parameter is now binary (0 or 1), NOT millimetres.
      All disease conditions that previously used rainfall thresholds
      in mm have been translated to binary logic:
          rain == 1  → rain currently detected (wet conditions)
          rain == 0  → no rain currently detected (dry conditions)
